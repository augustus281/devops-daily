      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Pinning to a commit SHA (e.g., `actions/checkout@a12b3c4`) ensures immutability and prevents breaking changes. For convenience, major version tags (e.g., @v4) are also acceptable.",

      "explanation": "The `concurrency` key groups workflow runs. When a new run starts, previous runs in the same group can be canceled (with `cancel-in-progress: true`) or queued.",
      "hint": "It prevents overlapping deployments or concurrent runs of the same workflow."
    },

        "docker: myimage:latest"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The `container:` key specifies a Docker image for the job. Steps run inside this container instead of directly on the runner.",
      "hint": "The keyword is the same as what Docker uses to describe images."
    },

        "They execute faster",
        "They can combine multiple steps into a single reusable action without requiring code",
