title: 'Dependency Scanning'
description: 'Learn how to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in your project dependencies using Snyk, Dependabot, and native package manager tools.'
---

Modern applications rely heavily on third-party dependencies—often 80-90% of your codebase consists of external packages. This creates a massive attack surface: a single vulnerable dependency can compromise your entire application.

Dependency scanning tools automatically detect known vulnerabilities in your dependencies and help you remediate them before attackers exploit them.

## Why Dependency Scanning Matters

High-profile breaches have demonstrated the risk:

- **Equifax (2017)** — Unpatched Apache Struts vulnerability led to 147 million records exposed
- **Log4Shell (2021)** — Log4j vulnerability affected millions of applications worldwide
- **event-stream (2018)** — Malicious code injected into popular npm package

These incidents share a common theme: known vulnerabilities in dependencies that could have been detected and fixed.

## What You'll Learn

This guide covers the essential tools and techniques for dependency security:

1. **[Fundamentals](./01-fundamentals)** — How dependency scanning works, vulnerability databases, and severity scoring
2. **[Snyk](./02-snyk)** — Industry-leading tool for finding and fixing vulnerabilities across languages
3. **[GitHub Dependabot](./03-dependabot)** — Free, built-in scanning and automated PRs for GitHub repositories
4. **[Native Tools](./04-native-tools)** — npm audit, pip-audit, bundler-audit, and other language-specific scanners

## Quick Comparison

| Tool | Languages | CI/CD Integration | Auto-Fix PRs | Free Tier |
|------|-----------|-------------------|--------------|----------|
| Snyk | 10+ | Excellent | Yes | 200 tests/month |
| Dependabot | 15+ | GitHub native | Yes | Unlimited (GitHub) |
| npm audit | JavaScript | Manual | No | Free |
| pip-audit | Python | Manual | No | Free |
| trivy | Containers + IaC | Good | No | Free |

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you should:

- Understand package managers (npm, pip, Maven, etc.)
- Have basic CI/CD knowledge
- Have access to a project with dependencies to scan

## Time Investment

- **Quick start**: 30 minutes (run your first scan)
- **Full implementation**: 2-4 hours (CI/CD integration + policies)
- **Mastery**: Ongoing (vulnerability triage and remediation workflows)
