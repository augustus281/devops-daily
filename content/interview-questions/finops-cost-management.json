  "title": "FinOps and Cloud Cost Management",
  "question": "How do you implement FinOps practices to optimize and manage cloud costs at scale?",
  "answer": "FinOps combines finance, technology, and business to maximize cloud value. Key practices: 1) Visibility - tagging, cost allocation by team/service/environment. 2) Rightsizing - analyze usage patterns, downsize over-provisioned resources. 3) Reserved capacity - RIs/Savings Plans for predictable workloads (30-70% savings). 4) Spot/Preemptible instances for fault-tolerant workloads. 5) Automated cleanup - delete unused resources, schedule non-prod shutdowns. 6) Architecture optimization - serverless for variable loads, data lifecycle policies. 7) Showback/chargeback - teams accountable for their costs. Set up alerts and regular cost reviews.",
  "explanation": "Cloud costs can spiral quickly without governance. FinOps is a cultural practice as much as technical - engineering teams need visibility and accountability. The FinOps Foundation defines three phases: Inform (visibility), Optimize (reduce waste), Operate (continuous governance). Mature organizations have dedicated FinOps teams working with engineering to balance cost and performance.",
