  "question": "How do you install and manage software packages in Linux? What's the difference between apt and yum?",
  "answer": "Package managers handle software installation, updates, and dependencies. apt (Debian/Ubuntu) and yum/dnf (RHEL/CentOS/Fedora) are the main ones. apt uses .deb packages, yum uses .rpm. Basic commands: apt update && apt install package, yum install package. Both resolve dependencies automatically.",
  "explanation": "Understanding package management is essential for setting up servers, installing dependencies, and maintaining system security through updates. Different distributions use different package managers, so knowing both apt and yum families is valuable.",
