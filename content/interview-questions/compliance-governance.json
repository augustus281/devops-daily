  "title": "Compliance and Governance in Cloud",
  "question": "How do you implement compliance and governance controls in a cloud-native environment?",
  "answer": "Cloud compliance involves policies, automation, and audit capabilities. Key components: 1) Policy-as-code (OPA/Gatekeeper, AWS SCPs) to enforce rules automatically. 2) Tagging standards for resource ownership/cost tracking. 3) Centralized logging and audit trails. 4) Network segmentation and least-privilege IAM. 5) Encryption at rest and in transit. 6) Regular compliance scanning (Prowler, ScoutSuite). 7) Change management processes. Frameworks to consider: SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR depending on industry. Shift compliance left - catch violations before deployment.",
  "explanation": "Compliance isn't just checkbox exercises - it's about building secure, auditable systems. Cloud makes compliance both easier (APIs for everything) and harder (velocity of change). Modern approaches embed compliance into CI/CD: policy checks in pipelines, infrastructure scanning, and continuous monitoring. The goal is making compliant the default, not an afterthought.",
