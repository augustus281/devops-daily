  "question": "What are the essential components of a shell script? Explain variables, conditionals, and loops.",
  "answer": "Shell scripts automate command sequences. Essential components: 1) Shebang (#!/bin/bash) - specifies interpreter. 2) Variables - store values, accessed with $. 3) Conditionals (if/elif/else) - control flow based on conditions. 4) Loops (for, while) - iterate over items or until condition. 5) Functions - reusable code blocks. 6) Exit codes - indicate success (0) or failure (non-zero). Always quote variables and use 'set -e' for error handling.",
  "explanation": "Shell scripting is the glue of DevOps - automating repetitive tasks, deployment scripts, cron jobs, and system administration. Bash is most common on Linux, but principles apply to other shells. Well-written scripts include error handling, logging, and are idempotent when possible.",
