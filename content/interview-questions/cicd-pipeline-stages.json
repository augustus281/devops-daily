  "question": "What are the typical stages of a CI/CD pipeline and why is each stage important?",
  "answer": "A typical CI/CD pipeline has four main stages: Build (compile code, install dependencies), Test (run unit, integration, and security tests), Deploy (release to staging/production), and Monitor (track application health). Each stage must pass before proceeding. Failed tests block deployment, preventing bugs from reaching production.",
  "explanation": "CI/CD pipelines automate the path from code commit to production. Each stage serves as a quality gate - if any step fails, the pipeline stops, ensuring only validated code reaches users. This automation reduces manual errors and enables faster, safer releases.",
