  "question": "What is the shebang line and how do you write a basic bash script?",
  "answer": "The shebang (#!) tells the OS which interpreter to use. #!/bin/bash specifies bash. Basic script structure: shebang, variables (VAR=value), conditionals (if/then/fi), loops (for/while), and functions. Make scripts executable with chmod +x. Use set -e to exit on errors and set -x for debugging.",
  "explanation": "Bash scripting is essential for automating repetitive tasks, deployment scripts, system administration, and CI/CD pipelines. Even with modern tools like Ansible or Terraform, bash scripts remain valuable for quick automation and glue code.",
