  "question": "How does SSH key authentication work? How do you set it up?",
  "answer": "SSH key authentication uses a public-private key pair. Generate keys with ssh-keygen, copy the public key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to the server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file using ssh-copy-id. The private key stays on your machine and should never be shared. Key auth is more secure than passwords and enables passwordless login.",
  "explanation": "SSH is the primary way to access remote servers securely. Understanding key-based authentication is essential for DevOps work, as it's used for server administration, Git operations, CI/CD pipelines, and automated deployments.",
