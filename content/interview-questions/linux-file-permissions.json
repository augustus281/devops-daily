  "question": "Explain Linux file permissions. What does the permission 'rwxr-xr--' mean?",
  "answer": "Linux file permissions are divided into three groups: owner, group, and others. Each has read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions. 'rwxr-xr--' means: owner has full access (rwx), group can read and execute (r-x), others can only read (r--). Use chmod to modify permissions and chown to change ownership.",
  "explanation": "File permissions are fundamental to Linux security. They control who can read, write, or execute files. Understanding permissions is essential for troubleshooting access issues, setting up secure deployments, and managing shared resources in team environments.",
