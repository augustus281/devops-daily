  "question": "What is container orchestration and why do we need it? Name some common orchestration platforms.",
  "answer": "Container orchestration automates container deployment, scaling, networking, and management. It handles: scheduling containers across hosts, load balancing traffic, auto-scaling based on demand, self-healing (restarting failed containers), rolling updates, and service discovery. Popular platforms: Kubernetes (most common), Docker Swarm (simpler), Amazon ECS, and Nomad.",
  "explanation": "Running a few containers manually is easy, but managing hundreds or thousands in production requires orchestration. Kubernetes has become the industry standard, supported by all major cloud providers. Understanding basic orchestration concepts is essential even if you primarily use managed services.",
