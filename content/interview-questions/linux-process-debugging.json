  "question": "A process is consuming 100% CPU on a Linux server. Walk me through how you would identify and troubleshoot this issue.",
  "answer": "Start with top or htop to identify the process. Use ps aux to get details. Check strace to see system calls, lsof for open files, and /proc/<pid>/ for process info. For Java/Python, get thread dumps. Check logs, and consider perf or flamegraphs for deep analysis. May indicate infinite loops, memory leaks, or resource contention.",
  "explanation": "Systematic troubleshooting is essential for production issues. Starting with broad tools (top) and narrowing down (strace, perf) helps identify root causes efficiently. Understanding Linux process management and debugging tools is a core DevOps skill.",
