  "question": "What is configuration management? Why is it important and what tools are commonly used?",
  "answer": "Configuration management is the practice of automating and standardizing system configurations across environments. It ensures consistency (all servers configured the same), enables version control of configs, provides audit trails, and reduces manual errors. Common tools: Ansible (agentless, YAML), Puppet (agent-based, DSL), Chef (agent-based, Ruby), and SaltStack. CM enables infrastructure as code and is essential for managing servers at scale.",
  "explanation": "Without configuration management, maintaining consistency across dozens or hundreds of servers becomes impossible. CM tools enforce desired state - if someone manually changes a config, the CM tool reverts it. This is crucial for security compliance and reproducible deployments. Ansible has become dominant due to its simplicity and agentless architecture.",
