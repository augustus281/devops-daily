  "question": "How do you use grep to search for text patterns in files? What are some useful flags?",
  "answer": "grep (Global Regular Expression Print) searches for patterns in files. Basic usage: grep 'pattern' file. Useful flags: -i for case-insensitive search, -r for recursive directory search, -n to show line numbers, -v to invert match (show non-matching lines), -c to count matches, and -E for extended regex.",
  "explanation": "grep is one of the most essential tools for DevOps engineers. It's used constantly for log analysis, searching configuration files, debugging issues, and filtering command output. Mastering grep dramatically speeds up troubleshooting.",
