  "question": "Describe some common Git workflows used in team environments. What are the pros and cons of each?",
  "answer": "Common workflows: 1) Feature Branch - each feature in its own branch, merged via PR. Simple and widely used. 2) GitFlow - uses develop, feature, release, and hotfix branches. More structured but complex. 3) Trunk-Based - short-lived branches merged frequently to main. Requires good CI/CD and testing. 4) Forking - contributors fork the repo, used in open source. Choose based on team size, release cadence, and CI/CD maturity.",
  "explanation": "There's no universally 'best' workflow - it depends on your team's needs. Trunk-based development is trending in DevOps-mature organizations because it encourages frequent integration and reduces merge conflicts. Feature branching is great for teams needing code review gates. GitFlow suits projects with scheduled releases.",
