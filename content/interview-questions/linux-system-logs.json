  "question": "Where are system logs stored in Linux and how do you view them?",
  "answer": "System logs in Linux are typically stored in /var/log. Key log files include: /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages for general system logs, /var/log/auth.log for authentication events, /var/log/kern.log for kernel messages, and /var/log/dmesg for boot messages. Use commands like tail, cat, less, or journalctl (for systemd) to view logs.",
  "explanation": "Log analysis is a fundamental skill for troubleshooting issues in production systems. Understanding where logs are stored and how to efficiently search through them helps you quickly diagnose application crashes, security incidents, and system failures.",
