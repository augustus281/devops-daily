  "question": "What is a blue-green deployment, and what are its advantages and disadvantages compared to other deployment strategies?",
  "answer": "Blue-green deployment maintains two identical production environments (blue and green). One serves live traffic while the other receives the new version. After testing, traffic switches to the updated environment. Advantages: instant rollback, zero downtime, and safe testing. Disadvantages: requires double resources and can be complex with databases.",
  "explanation": "Blue-green deployments provide a safety net for releases by keeping the previous version running until the new one is verified. This strategy is particularly valuable for critical applications where downtime or failed deployments have significant business impact.",
