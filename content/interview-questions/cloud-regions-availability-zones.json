  "question": "What are cloud regions and availability zones? How do they affect application architecture?",
  "answer": "A region is a geographic area containing multiple data centers (e.g., us-east-1). Availability zones (AZs) are isolated data centers within a region, connected by low-latency links. Deploy across multiple AZs for high availability - if one AZ fails, your app continues running. Choose regions based on user proximity (latency), compliance requirements, and service availability.",
  "explanation": "Understanding regions and AZs is fundamental to designing resilient cloud applications. AWS has 30+ regions with 3-6 AZs each. Deploying across AZs provides fault tolerance with minimal latency penalty. Multi-region deployments add disaster recovery but increase complexity and cost.",
