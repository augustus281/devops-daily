  "question": "What is chaos engineering and how would you implement it safely in a production environment?",
  "answer": "Chaos engineering is the practice of intentionally injecting failures to test system resilience. Implementation: start with hypothesis about system behavior, define minimal blast radius, begin in staging, use tools like Chaos Monkey or Litmus, inject failures (pod terminations, network latency, resource exhaustion), monitor golden signals, automate rollback on unexpected impact, gradually expand to production during low-traffic periods with team monitoring.",
  "explanation": "Chaos engineering's goal is finding weaknesses before they find you. It builds confidence in system resilience and uncovers hidden dependencies. The key is controlled, observable experiments with safety measures - not random destruction. Netflix pioneered this with Chaos Monkey, and it's now standard practice at large-scale organizations.",
