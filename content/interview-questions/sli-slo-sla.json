  "question": "Explain the difference between SLI, SLO, and SLA with examples.",
  "answer": "SLI (Service Level Indicator) is a metric measuring service behavior (e.g., latency, error rate). SLO (Service Level Objective) is an internal target for that metric (e.g., 99.9% availability). SLA (Service Level Agreement) is an external contract with customers specifying consequences for missing targets. Example: SLI = request latency, SLO = 95% of requests < 200ms, SLA = credits if monthly availability drops below 99.5%.",
  "explanation": "These concepts form the foundation of reliability engineering. SLIs help measure user experience, SLOs balance reliability with feature velocity, and SLAs formalize business commitments. Without clear SLOs, teams either over-engineer for unnecessary reliability or ship too fast and burn out on incidents.",
