  "question": "Explain the Git staging area. What is the difference between git add, git commit, and git push?",
  "answer": "Git has three states: working directory (untracked changes), staging area (changes ready to commit), and repository (committed history). 'git add' moves changes to staging, 'git commit' saves staged changes to local repository, 'git push' uploads commits to remote. This workflow allows selective commits and careful change management.",
  "explanation": "The staging area is Git's key feature that separates it from older version control systems. It lets you prepare commits with exactly the changes you want, review before committing, and create atomic commits that represent single logical changes.",
