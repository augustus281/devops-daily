  "question": "What is the difference between a Docker image and a container? How do they relate to each other?",
  "answer": "A Docker image is a read-only template containing application code, dependencies, and configuration. A container is a running instance of an image. You can create multiple containers from one image. Images are built from Dockerfiles and stored in registries. Containers are ephemeral - they can be started, stopped, and destroyed.",
  "explanation": "Understanding the image/container distinction is fundamental to Docker. Think of an image as a class definition and a container as an object instance. This relationship enables consistent deployments across environments - the same image produces identical containers everywhere.",
