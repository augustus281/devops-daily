  "question": "Explain the different phases of a Kubernetes Pod lifecycle and what happens during each phase.",
  "answer": "A Kubernetes Pod goes through several phases: Pending (waiting for scheduling or image pulls), Running (at least one container is running), Succeeded (all containers terminated successfully), Failed (at least one container failed), and Unknown (Pod state cannot be determined). Each phase reflects the Pod's current status in the cluster.",
  "explanation": "Understanding Pod lifecycle is crucial for debugging applications and implementing proper health checks. The lifecycle begins when a Pod is created and ends when it's deleted or evicted. During this time, Kubernetes continuously monitors and manages the Pod's state through its control loops.",
